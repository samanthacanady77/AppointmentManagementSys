•  This is the Appointment Management System application that handles adding customers and scheduling appointments. Javafx was used to create a simple and intuitive menu. You can create, modiy, and delete appointment and customer data. This data is stored in and retrieved from a MySQL database. A login screen exists that tracks successful and unsuccessful login attempts. All appointment times adjust based on the user's location. Appointments can only be created during business hours in Eastern time. Basic error handling and data verifcation checks are used. A few simple reports can be generated. The Login menu translates to French based on the user's language settings.
