# Appointment Management System

The Appointment Management System is an application that allows users to add customers and schedule appointments. It utilizes JavaFX to create a simple and intuitive menu. The application supports creating, modifying, and deleting appointment and customer data, which is stored in a MySQL database. The login screen keeps track of successful and unsuccessful login attempts. All appointment times adjust based on the user's location, and appointments can only be created during business hours in Eastern time. Basic error handling and data verification checks are implemented, and the application also includes a few simple reports. The Login menu can be translated into French based on the user's language settings.
